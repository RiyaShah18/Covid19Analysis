# Covid19Analysis

In this project, I have employed worldwide data on Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations ('CovidDeaths.xlsx' and 'CovidVaccinations.xlsx'). Data exploration has been done using SQL (refer to 'Data Exploration.sql') to analyze and understand the regional impacts of Covid-19. For data visualization, I utilized Tableau, a data visualization tool, to present our analysis on a dashboard, which includes charts, graphs, and a map (see 'Covid-Dashboard using Tableau.PNG'). The data used for visualization has been saved in separate files, such as 'Tableau Table1.xlsx,' 'Tableau Table2.xlsx,' and so on, while the corresponding queries are stored in a dedicated file (refer 'Tableau SQL Queries.sql').
